# <%= config.name %> Setup

Please follow the below steps to get started, if you encounter any issues installing the dependencies or provisioning the vm please check the [Common Issues](#common-issues) section first.

## Clone the project

Clone the project into your local file system:

```bash
git clone <%= config.git_url %>
```

## Install Dependencies

1. Install the latest version of Hem from https://github.com/inviqa/hem

2. Install the latest version of Vagrant from [http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

## Provision Environment

You can now build the development environment for the first time. In the project directory, execute the following command:

    $ hem vm up

You should now be able to access the site at [http://<%= config.hostname %>](http://<%= config.hostname %>)

## Hem Usage

With the Hem enabled environment up and running please make use of the following commands for day to day usage.

```bash
hem vm start  # Starts the vm without the overhead of provisioning
hem vm stop   # Graceful halt of the vm
hem vm ssh    # Start an SSH session on the VM
hem vm mysql  # Connect to the database on the VM
```

## Common Issues

As setup issues are encountered please detail with step by step fix instructions, and where possible update the project itself to provide a more permanent fix.
